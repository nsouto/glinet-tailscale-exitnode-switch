## Safety recommendations

Before installing:

1. Ensure you can access your router via a reliable method (LAN/SSH).
2. Make backups of any files you care about (the installer also creates backups).

   - Run the uninstall command, or
   - Restore the created backups manually.

If you are not comfortable with shell scripting or router recovery procedures, do not install this.
